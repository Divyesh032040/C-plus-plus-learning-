    What is the difference between a class and an object?

    3. Why use OOPs?

    OOPs allows clarity in programming thereby allowing simplicity in solving complex problems
    Code can be reused through inheritance thereby reducing redundancy
    Data and code are bound together by encapsulation
    OOPs allows data hiding, therefore, private data is kept confidential
    Problems can be divided into different parts making it simple to solve
    The concept of polymorphism gives flexibility to the program by allowing the entities to have multiple forms

    4. What are the main features of OOPs?

    Inheritance
    Encapsulation
    Polymorphism
    Data Abstraction

    5. What is an object?

An object is a real-world entity which is the basic unit of OOPs for example chair, cat, dog, etc. Different objects have different states or attributes, and behaviors.
6. What is a class?

A class is a prototype that consists of objects in different states and with different behaviors. It has a number of methods that are common the objects present within that class.
7. What is the difference between a class and a structure?

Class: User-defined blueprint from which objects are created. It consists of methods or set of instructions that are to be performed on the objects.

Structure: A structure is basically a user-defined collection of variables which are of different data types.


8. Can you call the base class method without creating an instance?

Yes, you can call the base class without instantiating it if:

    It is a static method
    The base class is inherited by some other subclass

10. What is inheritance?

Inheritance is a feature of OOPs which allows classes inherit common properties from other classes. For example, if there is a class such as ‘vehicle’, other classes like ‘car’, ‘bike’, etc can inherit common properties from the vehicle class. This property helps you get rid of redundant code thereby reducing the overall size of the code.

11. What are the different types of inheritance?

    Single inheritance
    Multiple inheritance
    Multilevel inheritance
    Hierarchical inheritance
    Hybrid inheritance

    13. What is hybrid inheritance?

Hybrid inheritance is a combination of multiple and multi-level inheritance.

14. What is hierarchical inheritance?

Hierarchical inheritance refers to inheritance where one base class has more than one subclasses. For example, the vehicle class can have ‘car’, ‘bike’, etc as its subclasses.

15. What are the limitations of inheritance?

    Increases the time and effort required to execute a program as it requires jumping back and forth between different classes
    The parent class and the child class get tightly coupled
    Any modifications to the program would require changes both in the parent as well as the child class
    Needs careful implementation else would lead to incorrect results

    16. What is a superclass?

A superclass or base class is a class that acts as a parent to some other class or classes. For example, the Vehicle class is a superclass of class Car.

17. What is a subclass?

A class that inherits from another class is called the subclass. For example, the class Car is a subclass or a derived of Vehicle class.
